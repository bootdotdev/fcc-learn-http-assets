# Assets for "Learn HTTP" on FreeCodeCamp

This is a snapshot of the code samples for the ["Learn HTTP" course](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-http) on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) at the time the video for FreeCodeCamp was released on YouTube. If you want the most up-to-date version of the code, please visit the official [Boot.dev course](https://boot.dev/courses/learn-http). Otherwise, if you're looking for the files used in the video, you're in the right place!

## A note on the API used in the course coding assignments

The API used throughout the course is a *live* API hosted on Boot.dev. There is a *chance* that the API will change in the future, which will of course break any code that interacts with it, but it's unlikely. If it does change, I'll update this repo with an explanation.

The base URL of the API is: `https://api.boot.dev/v1/courses_rest_api/learn-http/`

## Alternative APIs you can practice with

If you want to practice writing client-side HTTP code against a live API, here are some alternative options I would recommend:

* [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)
* [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/)
